> Try running the container without pulling the image. Explain what happened.

1. If the image is not available locally, running the `docker run` command will automatically search DockerHub for it. If the image is found, Docker will pull it and then run the container. 

2. During this process, you'll see `Pull complete` messages for each layer as it downloads (if the image was already available locally, these layers would be cached). 

3. The final message displayed will be the container id, indicating that the container has started successfully.

```bash
armagan@ ~ $ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
0581e4b8c0e1   nginx:stable        "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   10 minutes ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp     my-nginx
```

> Try pulling the same image from Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

```bash
armagan@ ~ $ docker run --name my-nginx -p 8080:80 -d public.ecr.aws/nginx/nginx:stable
```
