## Where You Can Find Container Images?

Container images can be found in various public registries, including:

- **Docker Hub**: The largest and most popular container registry that hosts a vast array of both official and user-submitted images.
- **Quay.io**: A public registry developed by CoreOS, which is now part of Red Hat. It includes features such as security scanning of images.
- **Others**: There are other registries such as the Google Container Registry (GCR), Microsoft Container Registry (MCR), Amazon ECR Public Gallery and more.

By default, the Docker engine searches for images on DockerHub unless you explicitly specify a different registry in the image name.

## Let's Deploy an Offical Image

This guide explains how to pull a Docker image from a public repository and run it. We'll use the [official Nginx image from DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) as an example.

### Pulling the Nginx Image

To pull the nginx image from Docker Hub, which is a public repository, use the following command:

```bash
docker pull nginx
```

However, it's important to note that this command will default to pulling the image with the `latest` tag. To specify a particular version, such as `stable`, you need to include the version tag explicitly in your command:

```bash
docker pull nginx:stable
```

### Running the Nginx Container

Once the image is pulled, you can run a container based on that image:

```bash
docker run --name my-nginx -p 8080:80 -d nginx:stable
```

### What just happened?

Docker creates a new container instance from the nginx:stable image from DockerHub and starts it. The application inside the container is now accessible by visiting [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) on your browser.

Hereâ€™s what each option means:

* `--name my-nginx:` Assigns the name my-nginx to your container.
* `-p 8080:80:` Maps port 80 of the nginx container to port 8080 on your host.
* `-d (short for --detach):` Runs the container in the background. This means that Docker starts your container and returns you to the terminal prompt.
* `nginx:stable:` Specifies the image and the tag (version) to run. By default, the Docker engine searches for images on DockerHub unless you explicitly specify a different registry in the image name.

![Hello,World](img/nginx.png)
</div>


## Bonus Points

1. Try running the container without pulling the image. Explain what happened.
2. Try pulling the same image from [Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/nginx/nginx).
