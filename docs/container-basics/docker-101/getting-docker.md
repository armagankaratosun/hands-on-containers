## Docker Engine (Linux)

Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications. Docker Engine acts as a client-server application with:

* A server with a long-running daemon process dockerd.
* APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
* A command line interface (CLI) client docker.
