Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows you to manage Kubernetes applications. The `helm` command-line tool allows you to install/uninstall, upgrade and rollback even the most complex Kubernetes applications.

## Installation on Windows

### Chocolatey

For those using Chocolatey, itâ€™s straightforward to install Helm:

```powershell
choco install kubernetes-helm
```

### From Script

Windows users can install via the script using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or a similar bash emulation environment:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

## Installation on macOS

### Homebrew

Installing Helm on macOS is easiest with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install helm
```

### From Script

You can also use the official script:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

## Installation on Linux

### From Script
